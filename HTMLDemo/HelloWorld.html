                Let's do that again. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. 
                You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. 
                You're meant to have fun in life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. 
                See there how easy that is. These little son of a guns hide in your brush 
                and you just have to push them out. Talk to trees, look at the birds. 
                Whatever it takes. You can't have light without dark. 
                You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Be brave.
